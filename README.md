Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AHSANATIQ98/Applying-Linear-Regression-Model-to-Predict-Exam-Score.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Applying-Linear-Regression-Model-to-Predict-Exam-Score
Usage
Run the main script to see the predictions and evaluations:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Data Collection
The dataset used in this project consists of study hours and corresponding exam scores. It can be found in the data directory.

Model Implementation
The linear regression model is implemented in linear_regression.py. It includes functions for:

Calculating the coefficients
Making predictions
Fitting the model to the training data
Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squares of the errors.
R-squared: Indicates how well the model explains the variability of the data.
