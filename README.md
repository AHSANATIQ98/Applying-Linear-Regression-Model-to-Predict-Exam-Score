# Applying-Linear-Regression-Model-to-Predict-Exam-Score
This project implements a linear regression model from scratch to predict exam scores based on study hours. It includes data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation using metrics like MSE and R-squared. Explore the code and see how the model predicts performance based on study habits!
